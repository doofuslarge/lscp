It
seems
that
what
you
are
looking
for
is
a
something
mildly
challenging
and
somewhat
useful
to
do
with
python?
Try
some
of
these
things:
Level
1:
Have
you
tried
putting
a
GUI
on
top
of
a
simple
console
program?
There
are
several
packages
that
allow
you
to
do
this
with
minimal
effort.
Metaslash
Covers
most
all
of
them.
Level
2:
Google
Code
Jam.
The
Competition
itself
is
long
underway,
but
you
can
still
try
the
qualification
round
questions.
Try
doing
them
in
python.
They
can
be
done
with
any
amount
of
complexity
you
want,
one,
two,
three
files.
Its
a
good
way
to
learn
to
build
algorithms
in
python.
Level
3:
Write
your
own
extension
for
something
in
python.
I
would
try
maybe
a
small
scaling
plugin
for
GIMP.
Documentation
can
be
found
here.
This
will
be
pretty
challenging,
and
provide
you
good
experience
to
contributing
to
open
source!
