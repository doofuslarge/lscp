I'm
new
to
C#,
and
I
want
to
use
a
track-bar
to
change
a
form's
opacity.
This
is
my
code:
When
I
try
to
build
it,
I
get
this
error:
Cannot
implicitly
convert
type
'decimal'
to
'double'
I
tried
making
a
double,
but
then
the
control
doesn't
work.
This
code
worked
fine
for
me
in
VB.NET.
What
do
I
need
to
do
differently?
