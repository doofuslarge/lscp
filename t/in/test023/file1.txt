<p>I'm new to C#, and I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity.</p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000
this.Opacity = trans
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to build it, I get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried making <code>trans</code> a double, but then the control doesn't
work. This code worked fine for me in VB.NET. </p>

<p>What do I need to do differently?</p>
